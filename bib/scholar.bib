abstract={Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) are two quality management processes that are integral to the success of metabolomics including their application for the acquisition of high quality data in any high-throughput analytical chemistry laboratory. QA defines all the planned and systematic activities implemented before samples are collected, to provide confidence that a subsequent analytical process will fulfil predetermined requirements for quality. QC can be defined as the operational techniques and activities used to measure and report these quality requirements after data acquisition.},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Metabolomics has shown promise in gastric cancer (GC)
              detection. This research sought to identify whether GC has a
              unique urinary metabolomic profile compared with benign gastric
              disease (BN) and healthy (HE) patients. METHODS: Urine from 43
              GC, 40 BN, and 40 matched HE patients was analysed using (1)H
              nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy, generating 77
              reproducible metabolites (QC-RSD <25\%). Univariate and
              multivariate (MVA) statistics were employed. A parsimonious
              biomarker profile of GC vs HE was investigated using LASSO
              regularised logistic regression (LASSO-LR). Model performance was
              assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
              RESULTS: GC displayed a clear discriminatory biomarker profile;
              the BN profile overlapped with GC and HE. LASSO-LR identified
              three discriminatory metabolites: 2-hydroxyisobutyrate,
              3-indoxylsulfate, and alanine, which produced a discriminatory
              model with an area under the ROC of 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: GC
              patients have a distinct urinary metabolite profile. This study
              shows clinical potential for metabolic profiling for early GC
              diagnosis.",
